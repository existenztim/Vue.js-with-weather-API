# In progress!

This project will be something I do on my spare time. The main goal is to get better
with API and Vue.js. So why not do what every developer has done atleast once... a weather APP! 

# Upcomming demo

Even tough the project is in early development it already does basic things like displaying city/temp/weather aswell as an weather-icon. Once I've added some SCSS 
a link with a demo will be shown here.
