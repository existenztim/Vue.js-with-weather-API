# In progress!

This project will be something I do on my spare time. The main goal is to get better
with API and Vue.js. So why not do what every developer has done atleast once... a weather APP! 

# Demo

At the moment there is no demo avaliable. The reason being is because I need to learn how to hide my API keys, or get them from a database. As I learn more this will be adjustet. But for now you will need to clone/download the project locally and use your own API key at row 29 in const APP.vue. 
Replace "import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY;" with your API key and you should be good to go.
